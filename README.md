Blog Front end

What i have:
- Home page with list of all blog posts
- Dynamic blog post page
- Login page
- Edit page, which is a rich text editor and ability to create, update and delete blog post
- Image upload page, which allow the editor to upload images to use in blog posts

Current Tech stack:
- React
- Tailwind
- Quill (rich text editor)
- Hosted on Vercel

Problems i need to fix:
- Error messages and logging
- Update UI components on hooks
- Better navigation (bread crumbs, protected pages)

What i want to add:
- Seperate editor to make it a headless CMS
- Use Astro JS or Next JS to implement server side renedering (kind of a backend thing too)
- Change from Quill to Editor JS to make a nicer user experince
- Style the UI better
- Add more features to CMS (Categories, Image uploads directly in the editorâ€¦)
